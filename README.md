## Description

The Little Guy is a property management application for small business owners who have a small number of rental properties they are managing themselves. The Little Guy saves landlords money by allowing them to avoid the expensive fees charged by property management and real estate firms. The app is also a great resources for prospective tenants. People looking for a new place can easily apply for a property near them!

This is a full stack Mongo, Express, React and Node (MERN) application. MongoDB Atlas is used for the database. Instead of a RESTful API, we used Apollo Client/Server and GraphQL. Tailwind CSS is used for styling. Additional libraries used include SocketIO for messaging and Cloudinary for image storage/delivery.

The app is currently in development. We will announce launch day here! Keep checking back.
